# Gatsby Admin

A visual interface to configure your Gatsby site.

We have not packaged this nicely yet, so it is not installable.

## How to develop it

For now to work on it you have to run it locally by doing these three steps:

1. Navigate to a Gatsby site of your choice that runs the latest version of Gatsby
2. Run `node ./node_modules/gatsby-recipes/src/graphql.js` to start the Recipes GraphQL server for that site
3. Open the gatsby-admin directory in another tab and run `yarn develop`

You should now be able to visit `localhost:8000` to see Gatsby Admin for that site!
